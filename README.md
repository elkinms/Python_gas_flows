# Gas flows calculation for experimental HVPE reactor for growing thick GaN films

The aim of this project was to find the optimal configuration of SiO2 tubes inside the reactor to minimize parasitic epitaxial GaN growth on the tubes while providing an acceptable level of uniform gas distribution near the template.

Practically, to minimize parasitic epitaxial growth, NH3 and GaCl gas flows were separated by an N2 gas flow.

Calculations were made using the Monte Carlo method. The modeling helped to find the optimal configuration of tubes and flow rates in sccm.
